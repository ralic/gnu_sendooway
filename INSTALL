------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sendooway uses the GNU Build System, also known as autotools.
There are just five steps you definitely need:

1) Dependencies
		Install the most conspicuous dependencies (both runtime and
		development files). These are PAM and GnuTLS.

		Even if Sendooway compiles cleanly you will need a super-server
		daemon like xinetd to use it. Install one! If you just want
		to test Sendooway, netcat will also last.

2) Configure build system
		./configure will scan for unmet dependencies and prepare the
		files which are needed to compile Sendooway. You are probably
		interested in the --prefix parameter: If you want to install
		Sendooway as /usr/bin/sendooway with its configuration file
		under /etc/sendooway.conf you should run configure as follows:

		      ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

		Have a look at ./configure --help for more information.

3) Compile
		Type "make" to build Sendooway.

4) Install
		Just type "make install". Depending on the prefix path you gave
		./configure in step 2, you probably have to do this step as super
		user.

5) Configure Sendooway
		Have a look at /etc/sendooway.conf (or whichever you used as
		--sysconfdir) and modify it to fit your needs. More detailed
		information can be found in Sendooway's documentation.

		You also have to configure your super-server daemon. Users
		of xinetd can find a template under doc/examples/xinetd.conf
