DESCRIPTION
	Sendooway is a multi-user and multi-target SMTP proxy that
	acts as smarthost. It comes with multi-user support, SSL/TLS
	encryption and is able to proxy multiple targets.

	The correct SMTP server is found by comparing the sender's address
	with the entries in fetchmail's or getmail's databases. There we
	also find correct authentication data for each account.

	Later, Sendooway will also be able to hand over incoming mails to
	a local MDA. Nevertheless it is designed for small systems without
	heavy mail traffic. There are plans to develop a faster and more
	secure version, but I don't urgently need it. Please let me know
	if you do.

VERSION
	The package version can be obtained by running:
	./configure --version

	The latest version is available at http://www.kuspbv.de/sendooway/
